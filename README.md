# Frontend-Only Spreadsheet (React + TypeScript + Vite)

This project is a **frontend-only spreadsheet** built with React, TypeScript, and Vite.  
There is **no backend connection**â€”all data is managed in the browser and not persisted.

## Features

- Spreadsheet-like UI with multiple rows and columns
- No backend/API integration
- All buttons are non-functional in terms of data, but **every button triggers an alert or console log** to ensure there is no dead UI

## Notes

- This project is for UI demonstration and prototyping only.
- Button clicks will show an alert or log a message, but do not perform any real actions.
- No authentication, data saving, or server communication is implemented.
